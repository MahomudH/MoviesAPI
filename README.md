<li>Swagger</li>

     Swagger is a set of open-source tools that help developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. 
     The most widely used tool in the Swagger ecosystem is the Swagger Editor, a web-based tool for designing, building, 
     and documenting RESTful APIs. 
     The Swagger specification, which is a part of the OpenAPI Initiative, is the foundation of the Swagger tooling. 
     The specification defines a format for describing the structure and operations of RESTful APIs.
